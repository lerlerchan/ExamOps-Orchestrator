Check the current repo structure and tell me what source code files actually exist vs what's planned in claude.md. Then prioritize and start implementing the core FormattingEngineAgent (Layer 1 rule-based formatter using python-docx) first since that's the heart of the system. Follow the orchestrator workflow in claude.md - write task files to tasks/backend.md first, then execute. If you hit any rate limit, wait and retry automatically. Auto approve all steps.
